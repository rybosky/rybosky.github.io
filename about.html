                     As a passionate photographer for over five years, I have been exploring the endless possibilities that this art form has to offer. I am currently a student at The Taft School, and I am excited to continue my studies in Brown University, where I plan to further develop my skills and explore new techniques.                  </p>

                  <p>  
                     Photography has been a medium through which I have discovered my love for creating new universes. I believe that photography offers unlimited tools to play with time and space, allowing me to create unique perspectives and perspectives that would otherwise be impossible. Through the lens of my camera, I have captured countless moments of beauty and magic, each one a reflection of my unique vision and creative spirit.

                  <p>While I enjoy creating new worlds through my photography, I also appreciate the beauty of capturing the world around us. I am drawn to the realism and raw emotions that can be conveyed through a photograph, and I enjoy experimenting with different styles and techniques to bring my images to life. Whether I am capturing a candid moment or creating a surreal landscape, photography remains my true passion, and I am constantly inspired by the endless possibilities it presents.</p>
